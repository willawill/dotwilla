### 2023 Wrap

 Spotify has claimed the title "Wrap" for their fancy product and it got so popular that Reddit copied it to be `r/place`. I worked at Reddit and am conciously aware how overhyped and stupid that company is but that's another story. Anyway, I have been inspired to give static blog a go and see how far it could help me in keeping a journal. So this is clearly an attempt that could be abandoned after three weeks. Oh well.
